Right now I am arranging argv[] in the right order on the stack to arrange argv correctly I push them in reverse order.
since the stacks grow downwards, I push arguments in reverse order. I calculate 
stack alignment to ensure th stack is 4 bytes aligned by adding padding
if necessary after pushing all arguments. I save the addresses of the 
arugments. After each push I store the address back in the argv and the address will 
later be pushed onto the stack to form the argv array. After arrangeing argv on the stack
, i push argc and th argv pointer. so in theory I tried to iterate over the 
arguements in reverse, push each one, align the stack, then push argc, argv and a null
null return address. 

To avoid overlow in the stack, I limited the number of arguments, by implementing argv to 128, this 
ensures there is enough space without crossing page boundaries. I  monitor the stack 
size by always checking the space used by aruments to avoid overflowing. In 
pintos this ahppens within a single page for the stack.

                           SURVEY QUESTIONS
                           ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want -- these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.
