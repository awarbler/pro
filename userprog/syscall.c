/* System Call: pid_t exec (const char *cmd_line) Runs the executable whose name is given in cmd_line, passing any given arguments, and returns the new process's program id (pid). Must return pid -1, which otherwise should not be a valid pid, if the program cannot load or run for any reason. Thus, the parent process cannot return from the exec until it knows whether the child process successfully loaded its executable. You must use appropriate synchronization to ensure this.

System Call: int wait (pid_t pid) Waits for a child process pid and retrieves the child's exit status. If pid is still alive, waits until it terminates. Then, returns the status that pid passed to exit. If pid did not call exit(), but was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due to an exception), wait(pid) must return -1. It is perfectly legal for a parent process to wait for child processes that have already terminated by the time the parent calls wait, but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its child's exit status, or learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.
wait must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following conditions is true:
	•	pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process. pid is a direct child of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid as a return value from a successful call to exec.Note that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to wait(C) by process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new parent if their parent process exits before they do.
	•	The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a process may wait for any given child at most once.
Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and may even exit without having waited for some or all of their children. Your design should consider all the ways in which waits can occur. All of a process's resources, including its struct thread, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits. The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in “userprog/process.c”) from main() (in “threads/init.c”). We suggest that you implement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().
Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest.

System Call: bool create (const char *file, unsigned initial_size) Creates a new file called file initially initial_size bytes in size. Returns true if successful, false otherwise. Creating a new file does not open it: opening the new file is a separate operation which would require a open system call.

System Call: bool remove (const char *file) Deletes the file called file. Returns true if successful, false otherwise. A file may be removed regardless of whether it is open or closed, and removing an open file does not close it. See Removing an Open File, for details.

System Call: int open (const char *file) Opens the file called file. Returns a nonnegative integer handle called a "file descriptor" (fd), or -1 if the file could not be opened.
File descriptors numbered 0 and 1 are reserved for the console: fd 0 (STDIN_FILENO) is standard input, fd 1 (STDOUT_FILENO) is standard output. The open system call will never return either of these file descriptors, which are valid as system call arguments only as explicitly described below.
Each process has an independent set of file descriptors. File descriptors are not inherited by child processes.
When a single file is opened more than once, whether by a single process or different processes, each open returns a new file descriptor. Different file descriptors for a single file are closed independently in separate calls to close and they do not share a file position.

System Call: int filesize (int fd) Returns the size, in bytes, of the file open as fd.

System Call: int read (int fd, void *buffer, unsigned size) Reads size bytes from the file open as fd into buffer. Returns the number of bytes actually read (0 at end of file), or -1 if the file could not be read (due to a condition other than end of file). Fd 0 reads from the keyboard using input_getc().


System Call: void seek (int fd, unsigned position) Changes the next byte to be read or written in open file fd to position, expressed in bytes from the beginning of the file. (Thus, a position of 0 is the file's start.)
A seek past the current end of a file is not an error. A later read obtains 0 bytes, indicating end of file. A later write extends the file, filling any unwritten gap with zeros. (However, in Pintos files have a fixed length until project 4 is complete, so writes past end of file will return an error.) These semantics are implemented in the file system and do not require any special effort in system call implementation.

System Call: unsigned tell (int fd)
Returns the position of the next byte to be read or written in open file fd, expressed in bytes from the beginning of the file.

System Call: void close (int fd)
Closes file descriptor fd. Exiting or terminating a process implicitly closes all its open file descriptors, as if by calling this function for each one.
The file defines other syscalls. Ignore them for now. You will implement some of them in project 3 and the rest in project 4, so be sure to design your system with extensibility in mind.
To implement syscalls, you need to provide ways to read and write data in user virtual address space. You need this ability before you can even obtain the system call number, because the system call number is on the user's stack in the user's virtual address space. This can be a bit tricky: what if the user provides an invalid pointer, a pointer into kernel memory, or a block partially in one of those regions? You should handle these cases by terminating the user process. We recommend writing and testing this code before implementing any other system call functionality. See section 3.1.5 Accessing User Memory, for more information.
You must synchronize system calls so that any number of user processes can make them at once. In particular, it is not safe to call into the file system code provided in the “filesys” directory from multiple threads at once. Your system call implementation must treat the file system code as a critical section. Don't forget that process_execute() also accesses files. For now, we recommend against modifying code in the “filesys” directory.
We have provided you a user-level function for each system call in “lib/user/syscall.c”. These provide a way for user processes to invoke each system call from a C program. Each uses a little inline assembly code to invoke the system call and (if appropriate) returns the system call's return value.
When you're done with this part, and forevermore, Pintos should be bulletproof. Nothing that a user program can do should ever cause the OS to crash, panic, fail an assertion, or otherwise malfunction. It is important to emphasize this point: our tests will try to break your system calls in many, many ways. You need to think of all the corner cases and handle them. The sole way a user program should be able to cause the OS to halt is by invoking the halt system call.
If a system call is passed an invalid argument, acceptable options include returning an error value (for those calls that return a value), returning an undefined value, or terminating the process.
See section 3.5.2 System Call Details, for details on how system calls work.
